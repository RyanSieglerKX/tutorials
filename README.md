# 🚀 kdb+ Examples

This repository provides concise, step-by-step guides designed to help new developers quickly understand and experience the power of kdb+ and the q programming language.

### Who is this for?
New developers who may struggle with the initial learning curve of kdb+ and q. These examples will help you quickly get hands-on with ingesting, querying, and analyzing time-series data.

### Why use these examples?
By following these examples, you'll:
- Experience the speed & efficiency of kdb+ in handling large datasets.
- Quickly learn core concepts through real-world use cases.
- Be inspired to apply kdb+ to your own data and problem sets.

## 📖 Examples
### 1️⃣ Time-Series Storage & Historical Query Analysis (Example1.ipynb)
📌 Format: Jupyter Notebook
💡 What you’ll learn:
- Storing & handling large-scale time-series data
- Efficient querying and filtering
- Using time-series functions and joins in q

### 2️⃣ Ingesting and Processing Live Data Feeds (Example2.html)
📌 Format: HTML (run in q terminal)
💡 What you’ll learn:
- Real-time data ingestion 
- Simulate live data streaming
- Using IPC for client server communication to capture real-time data

## 🏗️ Running the Examples
### Option 1️⃣: Use the Academy Sandbox (No Setup Required!)
The fastest way to try these examples is via the KX Academy Sandbox, where kdb+, PyKX, and Jupyter are preinstalled.

1. Launch the sandbox environment at edu.kx.com, enter your email and verify with the code that you receive
2. From the sandbox, open a Terminal and clone this repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kdb-examples.git  
    cd kdb-examples
    ```
3. For HTML Examples ensure to select "Trust HTML" at the top.

### Option 2️⃣ : Run Locally
1. Install kdb+, PyKX, and Jupyter Notebooks:
    1. Download kdb+ Personal Edition (kx.com/trial-options)
    2. Install PyKX via pip
    3. Install Jupyter notebooks
2. Clone this repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kdb-examples.git  
    cd kdb-examples
    ```
3. For HTML Examples open in Preview or Rendered mode.
