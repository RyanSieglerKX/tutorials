# 🏝️ Survival Code Challenge

Your research vessel hit a storm. You're stranded on a remote island. The only thing that survived the wreckage? A laptop running the [Community Edition of KDB-X](https://developer.kx.com/products/kdb-x/install) and these mysterious data links.

Each day, you’ll face a new survival challenge, and data analysis is your only lifeline. Can you make it 5 days? Can you find the signal you need to be rescued?

Join our survivors' [slack channel](https://kx-community.slack.com/archives/C0A7N4SQQKX) to ask questions, share progress and build together throughout the week.

By enrolling on this course you are agreeing to the [Terms & Conditions](https://academy.kx.com/kdb-x-code-challenge-2026-terms-and-conditions/) of this competition.

## How the challenge works

The challenge runs for five consecutive days.

Each day, a brand-new coding challenge will be released at 9am GMT on [KX Academy](https://academy.kx.com/courses/kdb-x-code-challenge-survival/). 
If you complete the challenge within 24 hours, you’ll be entered to win that day’s prize. 
Participants who successfully complete all five daily challenges within the week will also be entered to win the Grand Prize.

You can participate as an individual and complete as many days as you like, but completing each challenge within 24 hours and all 5 within the week gives you six chances to win.

This challenge has been kindly sponsored by our Partners at [Data Intellect](https://dataintellect.com/).
