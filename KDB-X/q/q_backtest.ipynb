    "# Financial Backtesting with q / KDB-X\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is this notebook about?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a **financial backtesting system** using KDB-X/q. We'll simulate a simple trading strategy and calculate how much profit or loss it would have generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use KDB-X/q for backtesting?\n",
    "\n",
    "KDB-X/q is a high-performance database and programming language specifically designed for time-series data. It's used by major financial institutions because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Speed**: Processes millions of trades in milliseconds\n",
    "- **Time-series operations**: Built-in functions like `asof joins` make matching trades to market prices trivial\n",
    "- **Columnar storage**: Extremely efficient for financial data analysis\n",
    "- **Concise syntax**: Complex operations can be expressed in just a few lines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Requires KDB-X to be installed, you can sign up and download on [Developer Center](https://developer.kx.com/products/kdb-x/install). For full install instructions see: [KDB-X Install](https://code.kx.com/kdb-x/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- To Install KDB-X Python: `pip install --upgrade --pre pykx` (This is required to run q in a Python notebook, but you can run the q directly from a q session if you prefer.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is PyKX?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyKX is a Python library that lets us run q/KDB-X code directly from Python. In this notebook, we use the `%%q` magic command to write q code in Jupyter cells, combining the interactivity of notebooks with the power of q. You can run these commands directly in a q session if preferred. "

    "## Step 1: Generate Simulated Market Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can backtest a trading strategy, we need market data. In the real world, this would come from historical databases, but for this example we'll generate realistic-looking random data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we're creating:\n",
    "- **Trades** for three stocks: AAPL (Apple), GOOG (Google), IBM\n",
    "- **Date range**: January 1-31, 2015\n",
    "- **Fields**: date, time, symbol, quantity, price, market cap\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters:\n",
    "In real backtesting, you need to know the **exact price** at which you could have executed trades. The `aj` (asof join) function in q makes this easy - it finds the most recent price as of a given timestamp, which is exactly what happens in real trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power of q:\n",
    "Notice how we can:\n",
    "1. Generate 10,000 random trades in one line\n",
    "2. Sort by multiple columns (`dt` and `tm`) with a simple expression\n",
    "3. Update prices conditionally by symbol with clean syntax\n",
    "4. Calculate VWAP (volume-weighted average price) in a single operation\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of data manipulation would require many more lines in traditional languages."

    "- `sym`: which stock to trade\n",
    "- `size`: how many shares (1,000 each)\n",
    "- `tradein`: when to buy (entry date)\n",
    "- `tradeout`: when to sell (exit date)\n",

    "This is the simplest way to calculate profit/loss. We need to answer two questions:\n",

    "2. **What price did we sell at?** (exit price on Jan 31)\n",

    "### The Magic of Asof Join (`aj`):\n",
    "\n",
    "The `aj` function is one of q's superpowers. It finds the **most recent** matching record as of a specific time. This is exactly what you need for financial data:\n",

    "```q\n",

    "- In pandas, you'd need to merge, sort, and use groupby operations\n",

    "   - **January 10th** was our best day with ~$13,000 gain\n",
    "   - The portfolio was volatile but generally trended upward\n",

    "### What This Tells Us:\n",
    "- The strategy wasn't consistently profitable day-to-day\n",

    "### The Final Math:\n",
    "```\n",
    "GOOG: ($632.76 - $590.70) × 1,000 = +$42,060\n",
    "IBM:  ($181.70 - $207.16) × 1,000 = -$25,460\n",
    "                           Total    = +$16,600\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight:\n",
    "While we made money overall, **IBM actually lost money** over the month. GOOG's strong performance (+7.1%) more than compensated for IBM's decline (-12.3%). This is why diversification matters - and why seeing individual stock performance is important in backtesting!\n",

    "## Conclusion: Why KDB-X/q for Backtesting?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated several key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time-series operations are natural**: The `aj` function makes it trivial to match trades to prices\n",
    "2. **Concise and readable**: Complex calculations in just a few lines\n",
    "3. **Fast execution**: Processing 10,000 trades with daily aggregations in milliseconds\n",
    "4. **Built for finance**: Features like VWAP, grouping by symbol/date, and temporal joins are first-class operations\n",
    "\n",
    "For professional backtesting with millions of trades, real-time data feeds, or complex multi-asset strategies, KDB-X/q's performance advantages become even more pronounced. What we did here in a simple notebook would scale to institutional-grade backtesting infrastructure with minimal code changes."
