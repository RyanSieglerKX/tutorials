# 🚀 ai-libs Tutorials

This folder contains concise, step-by-step tutorials designed to help developers quickly understand how to integrate KDB-X with AI applications.

**Important!** Intel-based macOS is not supported at this time.

## 📖 Tutorials
1️⃣ TSS on Partitioned Bitcoin Data
- Apply Temporal Similarity Search (TSS) across a partitioned database filled with Bitcoin data.
- Efficient TSS query execution across partitions.
- Handling temporal pattern matches that span partition boundaries.

2️⃣ IVF with Wikipedia Embeddings 
- Learn how to use Inverted File Index (IVF) search on partitioned databases containing Wikipedia embeddings.
- Partitioning data using K-Means clustering to improve search efficiency.
- Performing IVF searches and leveraging the ai-libs' flat functionality.

3️⃣ Combining Structured and Unstructured Data
-  Discover how to combine structured (Yahoo finance feed) and unstructured (SENS announcements) data
- Fetching Yahoo Finance ticker data using PyKX and creating embeddings with PyTorch on SENS data
- Integrating time series analysis with TSS and nearest neighbor searches with HNSW

4️⃣ Fuzzy Filtering
- This tutorial walks through two examples of where it may be useful to introduce Fuzzy Filters, such as for queries or data that may contain typos, international spelling variations, or misspellings, and would normally result in no relevant search results, or incorrect data being retrieved.

5️⃣ DTW Getting Started
- Discover how to use Dynamic Time Warping on financial NYSE data to identify similar patterns in price movements, even when those patterns occur at different speeds or times.

6️⃣ BM25 & Hybrid Search
- Explore how to combine traditional BM25 ranking with vector-based similarity for powerful hybrid search capabilities.
- Learn how to blend both approaches for optimal retrieval performance using q and Python.
